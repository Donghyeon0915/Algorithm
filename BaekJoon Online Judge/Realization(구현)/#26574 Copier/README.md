## 문제
<p>Your copier broke down last week, and you need to copy a list of numbers for a class project due tomorrow! Luckily, you can use your computer to copy the numbers for you. Given a list of numbers, each on their own line, print out the number, a space, and then another copy of the number.</p>

## 입력
<p>The first line will contain a single integer n that indicates the number of numbers to follow, each on their own line. The next n lines will each contain a single number.</p>

## 출력
<p>For each of the n lines, print out the original number and a copy of the number, with one space of separation.</p>
